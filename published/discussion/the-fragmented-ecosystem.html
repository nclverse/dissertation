<p>
A typical student in Newcastle University is introduced to a
nebulous and fragmented ecosystem. It lacks a unified architecture
and this results in a lot of time being wasted trying to learn,
unlearn and re-learn interactions. At the moment, Newcastle
University employs a set of apps listed as follows:
</p>

<p>
Blackboard: Keeps track of student materials.
NESS: University's own interface to keep track of student data and
coursework deadlines and submission.
Timetables: A web interface to timetables.
Library: A dedicated website for library to search for books at
various libraries of university, keeps track of loaned books.
Outlook: Web based email client developed by Microsoft
Crypt: Archive of exam papers
</p>

<p>
NUVision: Archive of lecture videos.
</p>

<p>
These are some of the web applications that a student typically
comes in contact on a day to day basis. A preliminary analysis of
the user interface of these apps reveals that almost none of them
share consistent user interaction patterns that help ease the user
experience. The only superficial one that can be pointed out is the
Shibboleth Gateway which enables access to all the apps from a
single point entry.
</p>

<p>
Some people go on to refresh the browser which can be simply
eliminate with an email notification which user can enable when they
want to be updated or this data can be shown on the Dashboard using
websockets if they prefer. This is detrimental for the server which
takes redundant hits and for the user since he is pointlessly
clicking on the reload button when there's no actual update. This
induces a lot of time consuming behaviour such as constantly
refreshing the NESS (current portal for getting marks at Newcastle.)
This in my opinion is serious time that can be spent elsewhere in a
more productive manner.
</p>

<p>
One another problem that results from the apps not sharing a common
database is that there is no apparent semantic separation of
concerns between the apps. Blackboard application displays the
coursework deadlines on a notification area which is immune to
changes done in NESS. This discrepancy results in confusion among
the students since there are two incongruous representation of the
same data. Each app deployed in the university at the moment takes
care of more than one thing with apparently distinct databases.
</p>

<p>
This dissertation proposes that much better can be done by imposing
an architecture that ties together all the different apps with the
same visual language. As outlined in the design section, all the
apps shown here are designed with core precept of having conceptual
integrity internally as well as amongst them. An overall
architecture and visual language has been developed to describe all
the applications from the ground up.
</p>

<p>
This problem can be eradicated by having a consistent knowledge
repository. My research pointed at two ways to achieve this. One is
to have a centralized database that takes care of all the
information single handedly. Other approach, which is much more
resilient in nature, is to have a distributed database that keeps
the information in synchronization across the different
applications. This dissertation adopts the former approach of having
a centralized architecture since it was of importance that the
various requirements and contracts between the data had to be
figured out before a distributed database was deployed.
</p>

<p>
But the major advantage of having separated these apps at their
concern boundaries is that it allows for much more focused
development. By condensing the amount of information each app holds
it drastically reduce the amount of complexity budget the student
has to store in her head while navigating a user interface. Unlike
Blackboard, which is a melting pot of everything university related,
each application in this ecosystem does one thing and one thing
only.  This endows the user to determine the most salient
information faster since the number of choices and user interface
acrobatics she has to perform is reduced.
