<h1 id="sec-1">3.3 Designing the Visual Language</h1>
<div class="outline-text-1" id="text-1">
<p>
One of the main challenges in creating software products is
developing the visual language. User interface design is a cross
functional discipline that encompasses areas such as interaction
design, visual design and information architecture. When developing
a design language, it is of utmost importance that harmony is
maintained across the whole spectrum of interface design. Harmony,
both internal as well as across, is to be conserved at a macro level
with a coherent visual language and obvious information
architecture, down to the micro level where consistency among
knowledge representation artifacts such as icon labels, module codes
and colour indicators come into play. Discrepancy among any of the
variables spread across this spectrum would result in reduced
usability of the end product. A successful act of balancing in these
results in a user interface which is easy to access, understand, and
facilitate user activity. These principles are encapsulated by
creating a design philosophy which employs a common lexicon of terms
to describe the various concepts that occur throughout the system.

<h2 id="sec-1-1">3.3.1 The visual language</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1-1">
<p>
The school of thought in user interface design recently bifurcated
with the advent of so called flat design. [Allan 2012] [Schiff
2015] Both comes with their own precepts on how a design aesthetic
is to be envisaged. Combining my previous experience in the
industry as a user interface designer and in the light of detailed
analysis of the two schools, the approach that I adopted here is a
synthesis of ideas from both worlds. It is an optimum which can be
found between the two styles by appropriating the styles to the
right context. The approach adopted in this project is as follows:
The apps use shaded look that is characteristic of the old design
aesthetic for all interactive elements. This is done with the idea
in mind that all elements that are pseudo-3D in their appearance
would attract user interaction since they indicate a sense of depth
which is characteristic of real world objects. [Apple 2002] This is
juxtaposed with a flat aesthetic for elements that are purely
graphic visualization of data but doesn't afford any
interaction. The logic behind this is that the user would be able
to quickly predict which elements are interactive and thus adheres
to the principle of least surprise. [Raskin 2002]
</p>

<p>
A user interface is much more than meets the eye.  As a matter of
fact, Donald Norman, a pioneer in user interface research outlines
a set of principal heuristics on his website that are widely used
in the industry to improve the usability of an application [Nielsen
1995]

<h2 id="sec-1-2">3.3.2 Usability first</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1-2">
<p>
ISO9241 [ISO9421] define usability as:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>

"The extent to which a product can be used by specified users to
achieve specified goals with effectiveness, efficiency and
satisfaction in a specified context of use."
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Seen in this light, the design language's main goals were in
maximizing usability. A more detail analysis is available in the
methods section but to give an brief illustration of how design
tradeoffs were made, it can be seen in this image from one of the
apps designed for this ecosystem called ProgressMate that the
irrelevant details were relegated to the back and only the details
that mattered were brought to the forefront.
</p>

<p>
Provide detailed discussion of the example.
</p>

<p>
One other thing that I have followed throughout is to minimize the
requirement of user interaction with the elements on screen and
making it intentionally harder when the action is a rare one. Even
thought one additional click might only amount to half a seconds
delay compared to one, this when conducted by 4000 users doing it
10 times a day results in 4000 * 2 * 0.5 = 5 human hours on a large
scale. This amount of time lost only due to an overlooked aspect
from the designer's side in alarming. Hence, considerable attention
was supplied in putting the relevant data first and hiding away the
irrelevant. A detailed analysis would reveal that this principle
has not yet been fully achieved yet, but I have strove for such
accordances wherever possible.
</p>

<p>
A corollary that falls out from this decision is that actions that
which are not used frequently are hidden behind two step actions.
Even though the experience derived by the user is largely visual
there are a lot of critical invisible parameters such as
responsiveness of a user interface plays a considerable role in
determining how the user experience is impacted. When it comes to
the visual user interface, the possibilities of representations are
almost only limited by the imagination of the designer. Since this
project attempts to create a suite of apps directed towards student
learning, it was of high priority that two factors were given main
focus: Primarily, it had to be ensured that no time of the user was
wasted and secondly that there was a coherent narrative spread
through the app and how it is all connected together.

<h2 id="sec-1-3">3.3.3 Coherence over Consistency</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1-3">
<p>
The design methodology adopted for this project outlines a
unification of the design using a consistent visual design language
as proposed by the style guides like that of Google and Heroku
[link] [link]. I have found from my experience over the such
guidelines while hinders the creativity of a designer. Since what
is being created here is a platform I had to ensure that the future
is kept in mind and all that this platform sets out is to have
overall coherence. That is coherence outweighs consistency.
</p>

<p>
Where possible consistency has been brought in, but it felt like a
better choice to make room for new design elements since a fuller
understanding of the ecosystem gained by observing usage patterns
after this ecosystem goes into production can only yield
understanding at this understanding. Only a preliminary
understanding of this has been achieved so far and it was most
sensible to leave it open. This allows new design elements to be
incorporated into the system at a later stage.
</p>

<p>
A system was to use a cogent visual language that covered the whole
spectrum of the apps. A lot of principles in constructing the
systems were borrowed from Design of Everyday Things and the Tufte
tetrology.  I greatly believe in the concept of personal computing
as an amplifier for human reach. And most if not all of the
concepts governing the UI has starts flowing having this as the
central precept. Inorder to maintain this, the things that had to
be done were tight feedback loop. Conceptual Integrity was
maintained.  Designing with the user in mind.
</p>

<p>
Each app has a primary colour and a secondary colour for
highlighting. The behaviour is made consistent with the help of
user interface patterns like the navigation bar on the top.

<p>
There are parameters of the system that something that honours the
consistency within the system can be made since there's more than
just visual consistency that meets the eye that keeps the system
coherent. This is discussed in the following section. Provide
detailed analysis of how information architecture has helped define
the internal consistency. The discussion section gives a thorough
account of the decisions that have been made across the
applications in this ecosystem to make the user experience as
smooth as possible.
