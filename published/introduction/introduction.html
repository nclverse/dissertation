<p>
The aim of this dissertation is to construct an ecosystem for
learning that is architected from the ground up to form a cogent
platform that students can leverage. This would be accomplished with
the help of a suite of apps that together aid them in their learning
process by employing a coherent visual language and behaviour
throughout the apps in the system. The central problem addressed is
to minimise the endemic problems that accompany systems integrated
in an a la carte fashion. I propose much better can be done by
providing a conceptual framework and constructing apps out of this
minimal set of principles put forth.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-sec-1-1" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-1-1">1.1 Background</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1-1">
<p>
The preliminary conception of this idea came into shape when I
started using digital systems enlisted in my university. I started
using these at a time when I was being exposed to the core
principles of Computing Science and I felt a major disconnect
between the architectural principles of these apps with principles
that I was learning in Computing Science. For example, when the
deadline of a course work or the timetable of a lecture is changed,
it gets updated on a system known as NESS and an email is sent out
but Blackboard another system used for tracking student progress
shows the unmodified deadline. This results in generating confusion
and discomfort among the students. The students who were oblivious
to the email sent out miss this fact entirely and end up getting to
know about this change only on submission time.
</p>

<p>
During my time at university I started building a few apps in my
extra time to help my colleagues on different problem domains. But
overtime I found out that my own apps suffered from the same kind
of systemic errors found in the academic environment. But this lead
to the realisation that this is a recurrent problem that can be
solved by imposing an overall architecture. Hence this thesis is an
attempt at unifying all those applications I developed over time
under a single architecture and growing it into a single unified
platform with consistent knowledge representation.  Software
systems found in a modern academic environment lack a coherent
architecture. Status quo is to pick modules Ã  la carte that works
well in a stand-alone fashion but not so well with other
applications in the environment. This creates problems that are
insidious such as duplication and erroneous data, incoherent user
interfaces and so on. To make this concrete, Newcastle University
currently employs a set of digital tools for catering to the
digital side of academics: Blackboard, NESS, Outlook, Panorama,
Timetables, Crypt and S3P. No two of these share the same visual
language or architecture. This results in the students end up
having to learn a new interaction every time they use a new
product. This learning remains non-transferable. This often works
to the detriment of the user as it results in confusion, reduced
productivity, erroneous and redundant data which all leads to
faulty decisions when trying to interface with these tools.

<h2 id="sec-1-2">1.2 The Solution</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1-2">
<p>
As a student who spent the majority of his life dealing with
digital systems and have seen others go through the same
difficulties, it felt worthwhile to choose my last year Bachelors
degree dissertation to come up with a solution to this problem. I
propose a solution based on my conviction that designing an
environment with a unified user interface and consistent knowledge
representation throughout, would enable the student to stay on top
of their academics, stay connected with their peers and teachers,
and to a certain extend, help inform where to spend their limited
time and focus budget on.
</p>

<p>
There are a lot of other additional benefits that results from
adhering to this methodology. For an academic practitioner as the
end user, this platform can be tailored to benefit them with better
data collection about the student performance and increased
interaction with the students with the help of software created for
the ecosystem. By following to time proven software development
techniques like modular architecture and single responsibility
principle, I argue that it also simplifies managing complexity that
arises from software development.
</p>

<p>
Now that I have outlined what this project is about, let me
describe what the focal points of this project was not. I have
increasingly noticed that bespoke constructs and context specific
performance optimizations most of the time compromises
flexibility. This means that it was in a sense worthless to go for
specific performance tuning when the final architecture hadn't been
finalized. This is not to be taken to mean that they are
de-emphasized because they were irrelevant but it is only because
of the nature of the project where the end requirements were not
available prior to development, it was most reasonable to keep them
flexible and build composable abstractions that are as general as
possible which helps to solve a wide range of problems. Focusing or
improving upon a certain facet of a software means that if that
component gets unused in the end, all the effort goes waste hence a
this project adopted a lean methodology of production popularised
by Toyota [TPS 1988] having in mind the core idea that effort
expended towards this project were least wasted.
</p>

<p>
Having described the background that lead up to the creation of
this project let us see the metaphors and and principles that
underlie the creation of this system in the next section.
