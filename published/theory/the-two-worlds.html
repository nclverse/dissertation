<h1 id="sec-1">2.1 The Two Worlds</h1>
<div class="outline-text-1" id="text-1">
<p>
This dissertation has been in major parts been one of building two
different worlds: The user facing interface of the system and
the underlying computations.
</p>

<p>
This is a visualization of how I model the two systems: The upper
layer being the front end user facing side of the underlying
structures. This division is apparent in [Do the TVTropes research]
and can also be seen in the Cyc product.
</p>

<p>
The dissertation will talk about how the ideas and concepts of the
first world are more cogent than the logic layer that lays hidden
beneath. It is also reflective of where my strengths and weaknesses
lay.
</p>

<p>
These systems are built on a substrate of complex underlying systems
where things are very fragile if you are not careful.
</p>

<p>
This is because the underground is always changing and could
potentially lead to breaking down of whole software ecosystem if
they are ever allowed to unmonitored changes. Though the software
system presents many ways to organize this complexity, the basic
nature of breaking on update is still incumbent/popular. [Invoke analogy
with garden and roots that run the system. Cut the roots and the
garden disappears]. This is because the frameworks are ever changing
owing to the whims of the makers. One way is to start from scratch
and supply as much care and control over everything by building them
from the ground up but the scope of this dissertation as it had to
be produced in a limited time didn't allow for such levels of
explorations.
</p>

<p>
H.G Wells in his famous book Time Machine invokes the image of a
world which is split into two. And it is said that what you doesn't
know eats you and I had to experience this first hand.
Pioneers of the user interface in Paolo Alto, called it the user
illusion. Include reference. But in actuality the world

We think in terms of metaphors, and the metaphors we use influence how
we think.

<h2 id="sec-1-1">The gestalt of the system</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1-1">
<p>
The systems that I am about to describe can be understood in terms of
metaphors relating to other systems. What I have envisioned is to
create a system with a common system, as the term gestalt suggests is
to create something that is more fundamental than the sum of it's
parts. The way I hope to achieve it is by creating a system which is
seamlessly navigatable and employes a common lexicon of terms to
describe the various concepts that occur throughout the system.
</p>

<p>
Metaphors employed here are primarily deviced as to give a narrative
structure and give a fully coherent meaning towards what I was trying
to achieve in the end. It would be able to infer from these
propositions how my actions were directed towards certain ends and
whenever certain things were made to be consistent in a particular
way, I'll be invoking these metaphors to explain why certain tradeoffs
had to be made for consistency.

<h2 id="sec-1-2">On juggling mental models</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1-2">
<p>
As software construction goes it requires the frameworks to be
internally consistent and follow some contracts. Much like how a
function deals with an input and chains it on to another. But when a
developer starts working with this, he is faced with the challenge of
keeping everything intact.

Picking libraries became an exercise in building taste on what is
palatable and if you identify with the authorâ€™s ideologies.

<h2 id="sec-1-3">On the dangers of metaphors</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1-3">
<p>
Leslie Lamport has an incisive essay on why the metaphor of biology is
limiting in the sense that it gives an amorphous definition to
programs that is inherently complex and not understandable.
</p>

<p>
And in this sense verification is indeed needed but in my research it
became quite an experimental field right now to adopt. [Provide
support here.] But given a chance and with enough knowledge next time,
I would like to develop the systems in a formally verified way rather
than using TDD and is something worth looking into if the system is to
be evolved into the future.

Using Clojure has disabused me of the praise people sing about it. It
is simply not so for an incoming newbie. You have to be well versed on
a large pool of concepts to help it to see the programming domain in
the way it sees. So Clojure makes everything simple only after you are
well versed in Clojure or Lisp domain for that matter otherwise it
only adds to the noise.

<h2 id="sec-1-6">Building an Experential Gestalt</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1-6">
<p>
In their book, Metaphors We Live By, George Lakoff and Mark Johnson
talk of something known as experential gestalt. They contend that a
cluster of other components are experienced as a whole by human beings
which they find more basic than the parts. My aim is to give the
ecosystem that I'm building a feel with all the individual apps
collaborating in a seamless manner to form a coherent whole. This
directly references the work of a prototype done by Rosch in her work
on categorizations done by humans. A recurrent complex of properties,
our concept of causation is at once holistic, analyzable into those
properties and capable of a wide range of variation. So one app in the
ecosystem can be seen as a prototype.

Once I have enacted the metaphor, all the decisions and constraints
that are imposed upon the system fall out from it. Since computer is
an ultimate protean system, it allows us to model the environment in
whatever manner we please. It is the ultimate imitation medium. The
user facing level is a universe and the underlying subsystems can be
considered as a rhizome that originates from a central point and then
spreads out. These when represented out
