<h1 id="sec-1">2.1 Metaphors of the Ecosystem</h1>
<div class="outline-text-1" id="text-1">
<p>
This dissertation has been in major parts been one
of building two different worlds: The user facing interface of the
system and the underlying world of computations that generate the
visual artefacts. The nature of these two systems I have been able
to realize are vastly different. The principles form a blueprint out
of which I have crafted the software for the ecosystem.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-1-1" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-1-1">The Two worlds</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1-1">
<p>
The user interface design of a software is utmost critical to the
efficienct functioning of an application.
</p>

<p>
[Reference about face here]
</p>

<p>
While design side of things allows for infinite imagination it is
constrained by the underlying world of processes constraints it
because of the limits of the computation.
</p>

<p>
This is a visualization of how I model the two systems: The upper
layer being the front end user facing side of the underlying
structures. The dissertation will talk about how the ideas and
concepts of the first world are more cogent than the logic layer
that lays hidden beneath. It can also be reflective of where my
strengths and weaknesses lay.

<h3 id="sec-1-1-1">The Visual World</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-1-1">
<p>
The first world is that of the user facing end of the
software. This comprises of everything visual as well as the not
so visual (UX) part of the system. Even though parameters such as
responsiveness plays a role in determining how the user experience
is impacted, for the large part the effects are visual. When it
comes to the visual user interface, the possibilities of
representations are almost only limited by the imagination of the
designer. Anything that is the whim of the designer can be
conjured up and represented on the screen but the key factors that
played pivotal role in this project where in developing a visual
language. Since this project attempts to create a suite of apps
directed towards student learning, it was of utmost importance
that two factors were given foremost importance. Primarily, it had
to be ensured that no time of the user was wasted and secondly
that there was a coherent narrative spread through the app and how
it is all connected together. I made made use of some metaphors to
ensure this tight integration and it will be detailed in the
following section. But now to detail about the second kind of
world.
</p>

<h3 id="sec-1-1-2">The Computation World</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-1-2">
<p>
These systems are built on a substrate of complex underlying
systems where things are very fragile if you are not careful. This
is because the underground is always changing and could
potentially lead to breakdown of whole software ecosystem if they
are ever allowed to unmonitored changes. Though the software
system presents many ways to organize this complexity, the basic
nature of breaking on update is still incumbent/popular. [Invoke
analogy with garden and roots that run the system. Cut the roots
and the garden disappears]. This is because the frameworks are
ever changing owing to the whims of the makers. One way is to
start from scratch and supply as much care and control over
everything by building them from the ground up but the scope of
this dissertation as it had to be produced in a limited time
didn't allow for such levels of explorations. With a potential to
step on each other's toes at least as often as they stand on each
other's shoulders.
</p>

<p>
Keyword: Interoperability between technologies.
</p>

<p>
Many languages will be spoken by the system and hence the central
database for communication is named Ivory Tower which is the name
of the tower of Babel which had a unified language. So the tower
of babel provides the source material which the programming
languages then use to describe the processes. It is to be noted
that even though the current systems only speak in one language,
Clojure, it is architected in a way it allows for polyglot and
diverse styles of programming.
</p>

<p>
The degree to which all the disparate pieces can work together.
We think in terms of metaphors, and the metaphors we use influence
how we think. Reference Metaphors We Live By. Hence it was key to
adopt an overarching metaphor for both of these worlds.

<h2 id="sec-1-2">On juggling mental models</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1-2">
<p>
As software construction goes it requires the frameworks to be
internally consistent and follow some contracts. Much like how a
function deals with an input and chains it on to another. But when
a developer starts working with this, he is faced with the
challenge of keeping everything intact.
</p>

<p>
Hell are other people's abstractions.

Picking libraries became an exercise in building taste on what is
palatable and if you identify with the author’s ideologies.

<div id="outline-container-sec-1-3" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-1-3">Why So Meta?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1-3">
<p>
Once I have enacted the metaphor, all the decisions and constraints
that are imposed upon the system fall out from it. Since computer
is an ultimate protean system, it allows us to model the
environment in whatever manner we please. It is the ultimate
imitation medium. The user facing level is a universe and the
underlying subsystems can be considered as a rhizome that
originates from a central point and then spreads out. These when
represented out
</p>

<p>
Meta is what shapes our lives.  If you are God. You can either
build a pyramid or build an organism. A pyramid remains a feat of
wonder and then probably devolves into running into ruin milleniums
later, while an organism might survive, enter a cul-de-sac or if
you ensure you produce enough of it, will billions of years later
build a pyramid or two. So this meta-phors deliver value in
informing your decisions.  A shift in perspective is worth 80 IQ
points and I’m trying to debug mine to at least 40.

<h2 id="sec-1-4">On the dangers of metaphors</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1-4">
<p>
Leslie Lamport has an incisive essay on why the metaphor of biology
is limiting in the sense that it gives an amorphous definition to
programs that is inherently complex and not understandable.  And in
this sense verification is indeed needed but in my research it
became quite an experimental field right now to adopt. [Provide
support here.] But given a chance and with enough knowledge next
time, I would like to develop the systems in a formally verified
way rather than using TDD and is something worth looking into if
the system is to be evolved into the future.

<h2 id="sec-1-5">Systems that build systems</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1-5">
<p>
Using Clojure has disabused me of the praise people sing about
it. It is simply not so for an incoming newbie. You have to be well
versed on a large pool of concepts to help it to see the
programming domain in the way it sees but once you are beyond that
plateau, leveraging Clojure leads to a simplified view of creating
processes and procedures.

<h2 id="sec-1-8">The gestalt of the system</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1-8">
<p>
The systems that I am about to describe can be understood in terms
of metaphors relating to other systems. What I have envisioned is
to create a system with a central core, as the term gestalt
suggests is to create something that is more fundamental than the
sum of it's parts. The way I hope to achieve it is by creating a
system which is seamlessly navigatable and employes a common
lexicon of terms to describe the various concepts that occur
throughout the system.
</p>

<p>
Metaphors employed here are primarily deviced as to give a
narrative structure and give a fully coherent meaning towards what
I was trying to achieve in the end. It would be able to infer from
these propositions how my actions were directed towards certain
ends and whenever certain things were made to be consistent in a
particular way, I'll be invoking these metaphors to explain why
certain tradeoffs had to be made for consistency.

<div id="outline-container-sec-1-9" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-1-9">Building an Experential Gestalt</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1-9">
<p>
In their book, Metaphors We Live By, George Lakoff and Mark Johnson
talk of something known as experential gestalt. They contend that a
cluster of other components are experienced as a whole by human
beings which they find more basic than the parts. My aim is to give
the ecosystem that I'm building a feel with all the individual apps
collaborating in a seamless manner to form a coherent whole. This
directly references the work of a prototype done by Rosch in her
work on categorizations done by humans. A recurrent complex of
properties, our concept of causation is at once holistic,
analyzable into those properties and capable of a wide range of
variation. So one app in the ecosystem can be seen as a prototype.
