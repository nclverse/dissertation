<h1 id="sec-1">2.1 Metaphors of the Ecosystem</h1>
<div class="outline-text-1" id="text-1">
<p>
This chapter details about the research made into metaphors that
were used to model the system in abstract. Metaphors employed here
are primarily devised so as to imbue a coherent meaning for the
whole project. As such, it represents general background knowledge
that informed decisions made throughout the project. They formed the
grounding for the architecture derived which in turn influenced and
justified the design decisions made. Throughout the rest of this
thesis, I'll be invoking these metaphors to explain why certain
decisions were made the way they are. Here's how they formed the
hierarchy that influenced the decisions made throughout the project:
</p>

<p>
[Metaphor informs architecture informs design principles inform
implementation.]
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-1-1" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-1-1">2.2.1 Metaphors We Live By</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1-1">
<p>
Metaphor is typically defined as a literary device used for
suggesting resemblance of one thing to another. But George Lakoff
and Mark Johnson in their seminal work, Metaphors We Live By
advance the idea that our metaphors are pervasive not just in
language but in our thoughts and actions. They argue:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>

</p>

<p>
"Our ordinary conceptual system, in terms of which we both think and
act, is fundamentally metaphorical in nature. The concepts that govern
our thought are not just matters of the intellect. They also govern
our everyday functioning, down to the most mundane details. Our
concepts structure what we perceive, how we get around in the world,
and how we relate to other people. Our conceptual system thus plays a
central role in defining our everyday realities. If we are right in
suggesting that our conceptual system is largely metaphorical, then
the way we think, what we experience, and what we do every day is very
much a matter of metaphor."
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Thus a metaphor has the power to drive the conceptual understanding
of a user. Computers and the processes inside them have been
compared to a lot of metaphors in the past, one that I think that
gets most close to the real nature of the device is one by Alan
Kay. He compares it to the ultimate protean system, one that can
take any shape or form. He writes:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>

 "The protean nature of the computer is such that it can act like a
 machine or like a language to be shaped and exploited. It is a
 medium that can dynamically simulate the details of any other
 medium, including media that cannot exist physically. [sic] It is
 the first meta-medium, and as such it has degrees of freedom for
 representation and expression never before encountered and as yet
 barely investigated. "
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
This remains true even today since the fuller capabilities of the
computer hasn't been fully understood or explored yet. It follows
that a computer can be programmed to fit virtually any context or
use case. The one that I think most befitted this dissertation is
to visualize the world as two. I view user facing end of the
software that includes the user interface, information architecture
and everything that the user interacts with as a universe. This is
where the name NCLVerse is derived from. The other world which
realizes this universe is that of computations. This is modelled
using a centralized client server architecture.  These metaphors
were responsible for informing the why behind certain decisions.
</p>

<p>
The following sections account for the rationale behind these
choices.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-1-2" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-1-2">2.2.2 Building an experiential gestalt</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1-2">
<p>
Lakoff and Johnson also introduces an idea known as experiential
gestalt in their book. They contend "that a cluster of components
are experienced as a whole by human beings which they find more
basic than the parts."<sup><a id="fnr.1" name="fnr.1" class="footref" href="Malformed">1</a></sup> This directly references the work of a
prototype done by Rosch in her work on categorizations done by
humans. A recurrent complex of properties, our concept of causation
is at once holistic, analyzable into those properties and capable
of a wide range of variation. My aim in structuring this system has
to enable a coherent whole whose sum is different when put together
than the individual parts. This has been realized with the help of
recurrent patterns carefully imbursed throughout the ecosystem.
</p>

<p>
Though it might look like these models were figured out foremost
and truth is quite the contrary. The apps were retrofitted in the
end when the final architectural fit was realized. The architecture
had to be grown along with the work and it was only with frequent
stepping back and revaluation that I was able to figure it out as
it stands now. This emerged only after a lot of experimentation and
constantly evolving the architecture over time to accommodate the
discrepancies. Even then the architecture as it currently stands is
not to be held as absolute and constant pruning and controlled
evolution is required to adapt it to newer apps and accommodate
evolving user needs. This means that the design guidelines and
models outlined for software development in the next sections are
to be evolved along as new apps are designed and never take them to
be steadfast rules.

<h2 id="sec-1-3">2.2.3 The Two worlds</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1-3">
<p>
The products delivered for this project encompasses two different
worlds: The user facing interface of the system and the underlying
world of computations that enabled this. The nature of these two
systems, I have come to realize over the course of the dissertation
are very different.
</p>

<p>
[Insert picture here]
</p>

<p>
This is a visualization of how I model the two systems: The upper
layer being the front end user facing side of the underlying
structures. The dissertation will talk about how the ideas and
concepts of the first world are more cogent than the logic layer
that lays hidden beneath. It can also be reflective of where my
strengths and weaknesses lay.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-1-3-1" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-1-3-1">The Visual World</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-3-1">
<p>
The first world is that of the user facing end of the
software. This comprises of everything visual as well as the not
so visual (UX) part of the system.  While visual side of software
allows for infinite imagination it is constrained by the
underlying world of processes constraints it because of the limits
of the computation.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Orbits as Courses
</li>
<li>Modules as planets
</li>
<li>Solar system as stages
</li>
<li>Departments as galaxies
</li>
<li>Galaxies form Universe
</li>
</ul>

<p>
The view adopted here is that of a universe and the student an
astronaut. I visualize each orbit as a stage of a course that
student progresses through. A set of these courses can be taken as
a solar system and a composition of these solar systems form a
galaxy which has been mapped on to a department. All the academic
faculty of the university can thus be thought of as a composition
of a large number of galaxies. Inorder to make this concrete,
Computer Science can be thought of as the galaxy in which G400 is
a solar system in which modules are planetary objects that rotate
in their course. This is where the name of the project is derived
from.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-sec-1-3-2" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-1-3-2">The Computation World</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-3-2">
<p>
While the user interface of the systems takes the shape of a
universe, these are built on a substrate of complex underlying
systems where things are very fragile if care is not
supplied. This is because of the nature of software development
which is ever changing and could potentially lead to breakdown of
whole software ecosystem if they are ever allowed to unmonitored
changes. Though the software development methodologies presents
many ways to organize this complexity, the basic nature of
software breaking on interaction with it is still incumbent. This
is partly because Computer Science is an emergent field which is
still not fully understood by humans, while various methodologies
have been proposed to solve the software crisis (Refer Out of
Tarpit and Formal Verification Here) no single solution has been
proved to be superior.
</p>

<p>
Given the case it was of much importance to hedge against the
brittle nature of software and the environment of constant flux
software work against. After evaluating these criteria the model
that seemed most fit was to use the model of a centralized client
server model.
</p>

<p>
Rosen and Shklar in their book Web Applications
Architecture <sup><a id="fnr.2" name="fnr.2" class="footref" href="Malformed">2</a></sup> describes the server model as:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

</pre></div>

</div>

<p>
This model albeit in a centralized fashion with a single server at
the heart of the services that acts as a data store with all the
other applications acting as clients to this service is the model
this thesis propose.
</p>

<p>
The central data store for communication is named Ivory Tower
(another name for Tower of Babel from the Bible). This abstraction
is the core data store from which the programs acquire their data
over wire and execute respective computations. It is to be noted
that even though all the current applications in this ecosystem
are written in a single language, this architecture affords
polyglot development and diverse styles of programming. This was
one of the primary decision drivers behind building the central
abstraction known as the Ivory Tower which can be enabled to
transfer data in any message exchange format.
</p>

<p>
Thus these two worlds, universe on the user facing side and a
centralized client server model in the developer facing end of
this ecosystem are the two metaphorical lenses with which the
design decisions framework adopted for this thesis imbibe their
meaning from.

<h2 id="sec-1-4">2.2.4 On the dangers of metaphors</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1-4">
<p>
Like any metaphor, the ones adopted here conceal some facets of the
idea while revealing others. Leslie Lamport has an incisive essay
on why the metaphor of biology is limiting in the sense that it
gives an amorphous definition to programs that is inherently
complex and not understandable, in this sense, metaphors we use to
understand the systems can be insidious. As mentioned in the essay,
the metaphors we adopt to describe the systems might take us to a
cul-de-sac.
</p>

<p>
Full evaluation of the drawbacks of these metaphors are has not
been fully determined due to the limited time scope of the
dissertation. Healthy skepticism is to be maintained whenever an
idea or a new concept is introduced into the system. As mentioned
earlier the models are not to be held absolute and the need for
excessively shoehorning a new application into the system is quite
possibly revelatory of the inadequacy of the model adopted, a
better approach would be to evolve the current conceptual model so
that it can accommodate them. This is described in the next section
which details about the architecture.
