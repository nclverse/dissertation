<div class="outline-text-1" id="text-1">
<p>
People are central to any software architecture. The ecosystem would
not be complete without a supporting documentation of all the
functionalities. The ecosystem as it stands now can be recognized as
a set of core apps and supporting structures around it. These
supporting structures are vital for fostering communities around the
ecosystem. This prose elucidates the kind of supporting structures
that have been built and analyses rationale behind the creation of
these structures from the viewpoints of the end user.
</p>

<p>
The methodology chosen towards this thesis is to tackle it from the
viewpoint of a human centered process to foster a community around
these systems. My views on building software was greatly transformed
by a short treatise written by Richard Cook called How Systems Fail
[Cook 1998] The author suggests that software doesn't exist in a
vacuum, it is made alive with the people who use the software to
meet their ends. He describes that they adapt the system to maximize
production and minimize accidents.
</p>

<p>
In this sense, it was of foremost importance to value the
expectations of the end user and the kind of actions enabled for
them by constructing the systems in certain ways. In this process I
have identified personas of 3 users among many.
</p>

<p>
First one: The student
Second one: The tutor
Third one: The developer
</p>

<p>
The core focus of this project has been the student and is tackled
in detail in the upcoming sections. Hence I will focus on the other
two groups and detail in brief how the design decisions made from an
architectural perspective adds value to the lives of a faculty
member and a developer.
</p>

<p>
For a faculty member, this ecosystem if extended would enable them
to collect student progression datasets in a much smoother way. If
appropriate application programming interfaces are put in place,
there is a huge potential to structure the ecosystem in a way that
it optimizes to collect data on various aspects of student
learning. A cursory implementation that can be done with the help of
the current set of apps proposed is to learn about interaction of
the student with the course materials using the Curriculum app
proposed in the discussion section.
</p>

<p>
From the perspective of a developer, the major advantage over
current systems is that all the apps are developed in the open in a
modular fashion. This means that reuse of the components developed
for these apps can promote code reuse. Moreover, the ecosystem also
enables creation of bespoke APIs that takes care of a single facet
of student learning. This means that even developers other than the
core team under control of these systems (students, faculty members
and the like) can build their own applications using the interfaces
provided.

<h2 id="sec-1-1">2.2.1 Support structures</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1-1">
<p>
I have identified that without supporting structures most of the
apps however well designed will fail to meet the user expectations.
Whereas, when supplied with enough documentation, it helps the user
leverage these apps to their full potential.
</p>

<p>
There are four documentation websites created in order to provide
support the NCLVerse. Two sites are dedicated for the developers
and designers of these systems, there is a comprehensive
documentation of all the core applications in NCLVerse for the
potential user of the applications and finally a website that hosts
this dissertation itself. They are as follows:

<div id="outline-container-sec-1-2" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-1-2">2.2.2 Code Website</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1-2">
<p>
The code website provides comprehensive documentation of all code
that has been generated towards the project. This is done in
Literate programming style. Literate programming style is an
approach to programming introduced by Donald Knuth [Knuth 1992] in
which a program is given as an explanation of the program logic in
for the human reader as opposed to the machine. This can be thought
of as a narrative account of the developer's understanding of how
the code works.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-sec-1-3" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-1-3">2.2.3 Design Website</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1-3">
<p>
This website details about visual language that comprises of various
user interface elements and UI patterns. This was inspired by the
works done by Google and Heroku in developing their visual
languages. [Material Design 2015] [Heroku Purple 2015]
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-1-4" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-1-4">2.2.4 Documentation Website</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1-4">
<p>
The documentation website details about all features of all the
apps that have been built for NCLVerse. A feature that has not yet
been implemented but not too hard to achieve is to have a
contextual help menu. What this means is that, whenever a user
wants help about a certain interface element, she can click on the
help button and then choose the part that she is confused about and
it would redirect her to that part of the documentation website
where the interface element would be mentioned in detail. This can
be implemented with the help of hyperlinks that map the interface
element on to fragment identifiers on the documentation website.
</p>

<p>
I have devoted a about 1/5th of my time developing this
dissertation towards developing these support structures since they
were a vital aspect for the students to learn about the new
technologies in the ecosystem. But even then there are drawbacks to
spreading the structures around. Having more than one entry point
into these sites means that they remain hidden for a user
who doesn't actively seek out for them.
